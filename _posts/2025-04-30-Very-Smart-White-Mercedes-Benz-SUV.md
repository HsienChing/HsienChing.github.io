我在加油站，汽車剛加完油，服務員正在結帳。

我前面的那個加油位置，目前沒有車。

突然間，有台白色賓士休旅車，就突然插入，然後倒車，直到完全擋住我的行車路線才停止。

於是我突然想到: "他是要我陪他五分鐘的意思嘛?! 還是太寂寞，需要我下車去跟他來個見面會?!"

正在發呆間，服務員很緊張地說: "我們會請他把車移走!"

好吧! 見面會終止了! 

很聰明的白色賓士休旅車，掰掰，我先走囉!

I was at a gas station, my car had just been filled with gas, and the waiter was serving me to deal with the bill.

There is currently no car at the gas station in front of me.

Suddenly, a white Mercedes-Benz SUV suddenly stepped in and reversed until it completely blocked my driving route.

Then I suddenly thought: "Does he want me to accompany him for five minutes?! Or is he too lonely and needs me to get out of the car and have a meet-and-greet?!"

While in a daze, the waiter said nervously: "We will ask him to move the car!"

Okay! The meet-and-greet is over!

Very smart white Mercedes-Benz SUV, bye, I'm leaving first!
