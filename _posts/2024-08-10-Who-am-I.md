台灣人  
始終  
有  
一個  
自我  
認同  
問題。

我  
30歲  
時，  
跟  
老教授  
講:  
"我  
最近  
才  
開始  
思考  
我  
是誰"

老教授  
說:  
"你  
算快了，  
我  
50歲了  
才開始  
思考  
這個  
問題"

他  
接著  
說:  
"還有  
很多人  
一輩子  
都  
沒想過  
哩"

Taiwanese  
people  
have always  
had  
a  
self-identity  
problem.

When  
I was  
30 years old,  
I told to  
an old professor:  
"I  
have only  
recently  
begun  
to think about  
who  
I  
am."

The old professor  
said:  
"You're lucky,  
I didn't  
start  
thinking  
about  
this issue  
until I was  
50 years old."

He  
continued:  
"There are  
many people  
who have  
never  
thought  
about it  
in their lives."
