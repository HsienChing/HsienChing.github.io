三十歲  
左右時，  
偶爾  
會  
出國，  
進行  
社團  
的  
國際  
合作  
工作。

鍾老爹  
才剛  
出國  
回來，  
里幹事  
就來了。

爹:  
"你  
怎麼  
知道  
我  
回國

幹:  
"總之  
我  
知道。"

爹:  
"今天  
很累!  
不想  
多聊!"

幹:  
"好!  
反正  
我  
只是  
要交  
作業!  
回去  
報告

When  
daddy Chung  
was  
about  
thirty years old,  
Sometimes  
he went  
abroad  
to carry out  
international  
cooperation work  
of the club.

Daddy Chung  
had just returned  
from abroad,  
and then  
the agent  
came.

Daddy:  
"How  
did  
you  
know  
I  
returned?"

Agent:  
"Anyway,  
I  
know."

Daddy:  
"I'm very tired  
today!  
I don't want to  
talk anymore!"

Agent:  
"Okay!  
Anyway,  
I just  
have to  
hand in  
my homework!  
I will  
write the report  
myself  
when  
I go back!"
