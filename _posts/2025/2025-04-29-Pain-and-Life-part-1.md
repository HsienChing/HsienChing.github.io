有人說，生命就是在承受苦痛中度過，我們終其一生都在承受。

這確實是一種看法!

但在承受苦痛與處理問題的過程中，我們得以重新認識這個世界。

擴展我們對世界的想像!

Some people say that life is spent in suffering, and we endure it throughout our lives.

This is indeed an opinion!

But in the process of suffering pain and dealing with problems, we can re-understand the world.

Expand our imagination of the world!
