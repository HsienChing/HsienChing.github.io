許多狀況，有標準答案，當然是方便我們去處理事情，除了風險低之外，成功率也會較高。

但生命中有更多狀況，實則沒有標準答案，於是我們會去討論、思考、儘管成功率不高，但共同面對風險，一起走過困難，卻是生命中難得的經驗! 

也許在通過考驗的過程中，也會有些收穫! 

例如:  
發現標準答案，不標準了!  
許多狀況外的事情，帶我們看到了一個新世界!  
而我們也找到新的路，去看這個新世界!

祝福我們，透過沒有標準答案的討論，看到新世界!

祝福我們!

In many situations, having standard answers makes it easier for us to deal with things. In addition to low risks, the success rate will also be higher.

However, more situations in life have no standard answers, so we will discuss and think about them. Although the success rate is not high, facing risks together and going through difficulties together is a rare experience in life!

Maybe in the process of passing the test, there will be some gains!

For example:  
Find out that the standard answer is no longer standard!
Many unexpected things bring us to see a new world!
And we also find a new way to see this new world!

May we see a new world through discussions without standard answers!

Bless us!
