我們有時候會聽到"忍受痛苦才會成功"

乍聽之下，似乎有道理。

但若認真去思考，可能又疑點重重，令人信仰崩潰!

畢竟若"忍受痛苦才會成功"

那住在醫院加護病房的人，那些忍受生死一線間痛苦的人，痛到極致，是否早就會成功到極致?

而沒有痛苦，就不會成功了嗎?

許多在生命舞台上快樂演出的人，他們不成功嗎?

在追逐目標，達成所謂"成功"的過程中，當然伴隨著各式的情感，痛苦只是其中一塊，若特意強調痛苦與成功的對價，只是一件奇怪的事情。

畢竟體驗痛苦，並不是目的。達成目標、導向成功，才是目的。

達成目標過程中，伴隨而來的各種感覺，只是過程。

若將忍受痛苦對等於達成目標，那目標可能將難以到達，畢竟目標是忍受痛苦，而不是達成目標。

搞清狀況後，我們將會專注於目標，而不是專注於忍受痛苦。

祝福我們都能專注於目標，導向成功!

祝福我們!

We sometimes hear "Endure pain to succeed"

At first glance, it seems reasonable.

But if we consider it seriously, there may be many doubts, which will collapse our faith!

After all, "you will succeed only if you endure pain"

Those who live in the intensive care unit of the hospital, those who endure the pain of life and death, the pain to the extreme, would they have succeeded to the extreme long ago?

And without pain, there would be no success?

Many people who perform happily on the stage of life, are they not successful?

In chasing goals and achieving so-called "success," of course, there are all kinds of emotions, and pain is just one of them. It would be strange to specifically emphasize the price of pain and success.

After all, experiencing pain is not the purpose. Achieving goals and leading to success is the goal.

The various feelings that accompany the process of achieving our goals are just a process.

If enduring pain is equal to achieving a goal, the goal may be difficult to achieve. After all, the goal is to endure pain, not to achieve the goal.

Once we understand the situation, we will focus on our goals rather than on enduring the pain.

I wish we can all focus on our goals and lead to success!

Bless us!
