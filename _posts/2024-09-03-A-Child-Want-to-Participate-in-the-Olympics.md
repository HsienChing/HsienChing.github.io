小朋友在看了2024年巴黎奧運的游泳比賽後，向媽媽表達他也想參加奧運。

媽媽給出保守的傳統答案。你需要自律，才能有辦法進到自我訓練的階段。

對話間，媽媽的情感激烈，小朋友儘管有點畏縮，但也回應，我試試看。

這個就是傳統家庭的原罪。

我也是在這樣的家庭長大，我知道這裏面對人的未來可能性的破壞力。

於是，我就來添加一點可能性吧!

幾天後，趁著空檔，我跟小朋友說，如果你想參加奧運，應該找專家討論，多找些人討論。

例如找游泳課的教練們，例如鱷魚跟Apple教練，他們在這行十幾二十多年了，知道很多遊戲規則，可以給你更多的建議。

每個人的背景跟立場都不同，你會聽到不同的訊息。讓你的頭腦動起來!

祝福小朋友因夢想而開始前進!

祝福他!

After watching the swimming competition at the 2024 Paris Olympics, the child expressed to his mother that he also wanted to participate in the Olympics.

Mom gave the conservative, traditional answer. You need self-discipline to enter the stage of self-training.

During the conversation, the mother's emotions were intense. Although the child was a little timid, he also responded, "I'll give it a try."

This is the original sin of the traditional family.

I grew up in a home like this, and I know how destructive it can be to one's future possibilities.

So, let me add some possibilities!

A few days later, during my free time, I told the child that if you want to participate in the Olympics, you should discuss it with experts and more people.

For example, look for instructors for swimming lessons, such as Coach Crocodile and Coach Apple. They have been participating in swimming activities for more than ten or twenty years. They know many rules of the game and can give you more suggestions.

Everyone's background and stance are different, and you will hear different messages. Get your brain moving!

I wish the child would start moving forward because of his dreams!

Bless him!
