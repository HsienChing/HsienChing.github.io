往往我們開始認真說明一些事實時，就會發現這世界充滿偏見。

但有趣的是，這些由來已久的偏見卻正好撐起目前的世界!

但也因為這些偏見，讓事實變得可貴，儘管我們得付出生命的代價!

祝福我們在偏見架構的世界，活出自己的真實!

When we start to explain some facts seriously, we often find that the world is full of prejudice.

But the interesting thing is that these age-old prejudices are the ones that support the current world!

But it is also because of prejudice, making facts valuable, even though we have to pay the price with our lives!

Bless us to live our truth in a world framed by prejudice!
