"努力就會成功!"

這句話，鼓舞了多少人，也就欺騙了多少人!

畢竟，當方向錯誤時，越努力，死的越快!

例如，一個公司的經營模式，原本就造成公司虧損。當越努力用同樣的經營模式時，只會加速虧損的速度，進而破產。

所謂的"努力就會成功!" 都是極為少數的案例!

鼓勵人們有動力去做事，當然是OK啦!
但是 常常都是"幹話!"
冏!

當 達成目標的基本狀態不足時，這類的鼓勵，只會成為"幹話!"

不過幹話，也是OK啦!

有時我們就差一個 "傻勁!"

"Work Hard and You Will Succeed!"

This sentence has inspired as many people as it has deceived!

After all, when the direction is wrong, the harder you work, the faster you die!

For example, a company's original business model caused it to lose money. The harder you try to use the same business model, the faster the rate of losses will accelerate and lead to bankruptcy.

The so-called "Work Hard and You Will Succeed!" are rare!

Of course, it's OK to encourage people to be motivated to do things!
But it's usually "trash talk!"
ORZ!

When the basic state of achieving the goal is insufficient, this type of encouragement will just become "trash-talking!"

But speaking trash talk, it's OK!

Sometimes all we need is a "foolish energy!"
