身體累積太多熱量，反映在體重上。

體重過重，頭腦也跟著不靈光，感覺不舒服。

很多夢想也變得漸漸無法執行!

整個人怪怪的!

於是開始不吃消夜，幾個月後，體重開始明顯下降。

為了保持肌肉量，又加入了慢跑，一周跑幾次，一次30分鐘。

2024年2月到10月  
體重由97kg降到88kg  
BMI由32降到29  
體脂率由30降到28  
肌肉比率維持30

身體比較容易移動，頭腦也變得比較靈光。

又有開展新夢想的活力了!

祝福我們能維持健康，並開展夢想!

祝福我們!

The body accumulates too much Calories, which is reflected in body weight.

When I was overweight, my mind was not working properly and I felt uncomfortable.

Many dreams had gradually become impossible to achieve!

The whole person was weird!

So I stopped eating midnight snacks, and after a few months, my weight started to drop significantly.

In order to maintain muscle mass, I added jogging several times a week for 30 minutes at a time.

February to October 2024  
Weight dropped from 97kg to 88kg  
BMI dropped from 32 to 29  
Body fat percentage dropped from 30 to 28  
Muscle ratio maintained at 30

The body becomes easier to move and the mind becomes more alert.

I have the energy to start new dreams again!

May we stay healthy and pursue our dreams!

Bless us!
