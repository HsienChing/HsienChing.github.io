博士是高等教育中，能給到的最高學位。

要培訓一位博士，整個社會得付出取多代價及時間。號稱 "十年磨一劍" 也不為過。

最近，台灣在高教產業供應鏈失衡的狀況下，有許多博士畢業後，即面臨失業。

而失業的博士們，還得面臨社會上的某些嘲笑，例如: "博士蹲不下去，做不了苦差事!"

這其實是個迷思，各行各業的專業都需要數年、甚至是數十年的培訓與養成。

在教育產業供應鏈縮緊的狀況下，要一個人跳到另一條供應鏈上，難度太大。

行業間的轉換，本身難度就高，而不是什麼，"蹲不下去!" 這樣簡單的描述，就解決了。

與其嘲笑，倒不如大家好好思考下一步該如何走!

祝福我們可以看破這種迷思! 走出自己的下一步!

祝福我們!

A doctorate is the highest degree available in higher education.

To train a PhD, the whole society has to pay a lot of cost and time. It is not an exaggeration to say that "it takes ten years to sharpen a sword."

Recently, due to the imbalance in the supply chain of Taiwan's higher education industry, many doctoral graduates are facing unemployment.

And unemployed PhDs have to face some social ridicule, such as: "PhDs can't stay down and do hard work!"

This is actually a myth. Professionalism in all walks of life requires years or even decades of training and development.

With the supply chain in the education industry tightening, it is too difficult for a person to jump to another supply chain.

Switching between industries is inherently difficult, and it cannot be solved by simply describing it as "They can't stay down and do hard work!"

Instead of laughing, let's think carefully about what to do next!

I wish we could see through this myth! Take our next step!

Bless us!
