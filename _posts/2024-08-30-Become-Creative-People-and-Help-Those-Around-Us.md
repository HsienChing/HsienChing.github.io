強尼戴普對畫家朋友的支援，並不是直接買他的畫作，也不是直接給錢、或借錢給他。

畢竟強尼戴普當時也不想買畫，但他卻想出更棒的方法來幫忙。

幫朋友辦畫展，弄工作坊、辦派對，找人來買畫。

甚至提供朋友住所，方便他創作。

最後，成功幫助朋友賣出畫作!

祝福我們也能成為有創意的人，幫助身邊的人!

祝福我們!

Johnny Depp's support for his painter friend does not mean directly buying his paintings, nor does he give him money or lend him money.

After all, Johnny Depp didn't want to buy a painting at that time, but he came up with a better way to help.

He Helped friends organize art exhibitions, hold workshops, hold parties, and find people to buy paintings.

He even provided the friend with a place to stay so that he could create.

Finally, he successfully helped the friend sell paintings!

May we also become creative people and help those around us!

Bless us!
