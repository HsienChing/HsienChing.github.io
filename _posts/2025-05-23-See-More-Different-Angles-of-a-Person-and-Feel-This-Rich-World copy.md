在整理某些人的生平事蹟時，總會發現原來我並不如原先所想像地那樣認識這個人。於是在這個整理的過程中，用不同的角度，重新認識一個人。

這點很有趣!

回頭想起來，其實我也不是挺了解自己的家人、或者身邊天天見面的人，儘管他們對我都很重要。

我們都只看到一個人的特定角度! 也許，關懷人可以是超越原先特定角度的方式之一。

祝福我們可以多看到一個人的不同角度，感受這個立體的世界!

祝福我們!

When I sort out the life story of someone, I always find that I don't know this person as well as I originally thought. So in this process of sorting out, I get to know a person from a different perspective.

This is very interesting!

Looking back, I realize that I don't really know my family or the people I see every day, even though they are very important to me.

We all only see a certain perspective of a person! Perhaps caring for people can be one of the ways to go beyond that certain perspective.

I wish we could see more different angles of a person and feel this rich world!

Bless us!
