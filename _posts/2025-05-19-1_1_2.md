活了大半輩子，我還在思考
為何1+1=2
到底是真理? 抑或是幻象?
是事實? 還是數學模型?

有的人或許會認為問這種問題，是否是走火入魔?
但有趣的是，當我們開始問這類型的問題時，我們會開始思考世界的真相。
究竟我們是活在真相中，還是活在規範中?
真相可以給予人們思考的自由，而規範往往是人為的暴力!

For most of my life, I am still thinking about 
why 1+1=2 
Is the truth? Or is it an illusion? 
Is it a fact? Or a mathematical model? 

Some people may think that asking this kind of question is going too far. 
But the interesting thing is that when we start asking this type of question, we will start to think about the truth of the world.
Do we live in the truth or in the norms? 
The truth can give people the freedom to think, but the norms are often man-made violence!
