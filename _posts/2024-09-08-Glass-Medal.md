2024年8月

小朋友參加歡樂遊泳比賽，得獎

長輩: "得獎，是金牌、銀牌、還是銅牌?"

慶: "玻璃牌啦!"

品質比較好歐!

不像奧運那個還會生鏽! ^_^

August 2024

My child participated in a fun swimming competition and won prizes.

Elder: "Winning prizes, is it a gold medal, a silver medal, or a bronze medal?"

Ching: "Glass medal!"

The quality is relatively good!

It's not like the Olympic one that gets rusty! ^_^
