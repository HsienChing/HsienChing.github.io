為什麼這個世界有很多話，不能明講?

老實不是很好嘛!

學校不是都這樣教嗎? 做人要老實!

然後老師就會舉"華盛頓砍櫻桃樹"的例子。
(這裡不討論這個例子的真實性，這只是一個代表性故事。)

回到家裡，家長也會再跟你講一次相同的故事。

所以，老實不是很好嘛! 怎麼會有什麼問題!

事實上，問題可大啦!

狀況有很多啦!

很多時候是跟生命與生存有關!

跟你的命有關!

舉幾個例子:

案例1:
馬基維利的那本書，君王論。一直等到他死後，才出版。
因為，該書的內容可能會讓他有生命危險。

案例2:
你的賺錢商業模式。
老實把他講出來，鉅細靡遺。
那可能會危害你的生意，被別人破壞掉，造成你吃不到飯。

---

很多時候，這個世界是有些"惡意"，老實的話，可能會有生命危險。

為了生存，"老實"這件事情是得認真看待!

不過

老實面對自己的人生，認清自己在哪裡，並抗衡世界的惡意!

老實面對，這點還是挺有用的!

祝福我們!

Why is there so much talk in this world that cannot be explained clearly?

Isn't it great to be honest?

Isn't that what schools teach? Be honest!

Then the teacher will give the example of "Washington cutting down the cherry tree."
(The authenticity of this example is not discussed here. This is just a representative story.)

When you get home, your parents will tell you the same story again and again.

So, isn't it great to be honest! How could there be any problem!

In fact, it's a big problem!

There are many situations!

Many times it is related to life and survival!

It's about your life!

---

Here, a few examples are given:

Case 1:
Machiavelli's book, The Prince. It was not published until after his death.
Because the content of the book may put his life in danger.

Case 2:
Your money-making business model.
Tell others honestly, down to the last detail.
That may endanger your business, be destroyed by others, and cause you to be unable to survive.

---

Many times, this world is a bit "malicious," and "to be honest," it may be life-threatening.

To survive, "honesty" must be taken seriously!

But

Face our life honestly, recognize where we are, and fight against the malice of the world!

Let's be honest with ourselves, this is quite useful!

Bless us!
