家裡的小朋友，現在國小二年級。

學校那邊說下周要進行跳繩測驗。

於是晚上就去練習跳繩。

練習完後，回家休息。

晚上睡覺時，床上有聲音，發現是躺在床上的小朋友，雙腳在動，手也跟著晃動，看起來就是在跳繩的感覺。

原來這就是做夢也在練習!

My son is now in the second grade of elementary school.

The teacher said there will be a skipping test next week.

So he went to practice skipping in the evening.

After practicing, go home and rest.

When I went to bed at night, there was a sound in the bed. I found that it was my son lying on the bed. His feet were moving and his hands were shaking. It looked like he was skipping rope.

It turns out that this is just dreaming and practicing!
