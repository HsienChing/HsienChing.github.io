有時候  
我感覺到的時間  
不是線性的

有時候  
我會在這個時間點  
覺得以前好像見過這個時間點的事情  
一開始就當作自己是觀眾在看  
事情正常發生

但發生多次後  
就發現  
好像可以改變事件走向  
只要在過程中  
加點小動作

但就發生一個問題  
那段感覺存在的未來記憶  
就突然中斷了

也許時間走向另一個分支了?

以我目前的生命經驗及知識  
無法解釋這些東西  
就這樣吧!

GOOD! ^_^

Sometimes  
I feel the time flow  
is not linear

sometimes  
I will be at this point in time  
I feel like I've seen things like this before  
From the beginning, treat myself as an audience member.  
things happen normally

But after it happened many times  
Just found out  
It seems like it can change the course of events  
As long as in the process  
Add some little moves

But a problem occurred  
That future memory that feels like it exists  
It suddenly terminated

Maybe time has moved on to another branch?

Based on my current life experience and knowledge  
Can't explain these things  
Let it be!

GOOD! ^_^
