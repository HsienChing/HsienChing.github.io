面對雜亂的生活，總會有一種 "心事誰人知!" 的情緒。

對自己的無頭緒的雜亂生活做紀錄，也許是件累人的事情。

但如果不紀錄!

那反而變成一種狀況 "我的心事連我自己都不知!"

也許記錄下去，能重新讓我們看到自己。

帶我們走出 "心事誰人知!" 的情緒低谷。

祝福我們透過記錄自己的生命，走出情緒低谷!

祝福我們!

When faced with a messy life, there is always a feeling of "Who knows what's in my heart?"

Keeping track of our messy and disorganized life can be tiring.

But if we don't record it!

It turns into a situation where "We don't even know what's going on in our mind!"

Perhaps recording it down can help us see ourselves again.

It helps us get out of the emotional trough of "Who knows what's in my heart?"

May we get out of the emotional trough by recording our own lives!

Bless us!
