雖然是夏天  
但山上的空氣很涼  
打開車窗  
很舒爽

彎來彎去  
快暈了  
就截彎取直  
慢慢滑下山

沿路看護欄  
大大小小撞凹的痕跡  
可見大家在這條路上  
留下不少的回憶

起霧了  
看不到  
打開霧燈  
儘管是白天  
也只看到前方數十米  
路況一路迷茫  
只好把雙黃線當軌道開

隨著海拔下降  
氣壓增加  
要不斷調整呼吸  
平衡壓力

趕在封山前  
來到平地  
重新感受  
台灣的夏天

Although it is summer  
But the air in the mountains is cool  
Open car window  
Very comfortable

Bend around  
Almost fainted  
Just cut the bend and make it straight  
Slowly slide down the mountain

Guardrails along the road  
Traces of big and small bumps and dents  
It can be seen that everyone is on this road  
Left a lot of memories

It's getting foggy  
Can not see  
Turn on fog lights  
Even though it's daytime  
I can only see a few dozen meters ahead  
The road conditions are confusing all the way  
I had to use the double yellow line as a track

As the altitude decreases  
Air pressure increases  
Keep adjusting my breathing  
Balance pressure

Hurry before the mountain closure  
Come to the plains  
Feel again  
Summer in Taiwan
