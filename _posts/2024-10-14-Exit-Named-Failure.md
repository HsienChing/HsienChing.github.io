我不喜歡失敗，總有種不舒服的感覺!

但失敗卻是將我從幻想與現實的差距拉回來的好事

很多時候我有過多的想像，或稱為幻想

在嘗試的過程中，經歷失敗

也還好有這些失敗，我才知道原來幻想與現實的差距有如此之大

而我那奇怪幻想中，到底還缺失了多少元素

儘管挫折，但這是很棒的經驗

透過失敗，認清幻想，也避免自己繼續處在一個幻覺中

當然，處在幻覺中，也不見得是壞事，有舒服的沉浸感，也是很讚的體驗。

失敗可以是脫離幻覺的一個出口

如果哪天覺得自己處在幻覺中，那就去找失敗這個出口吧!

祝福我們找得到名為失敗的出口，當我們現在幻覺中時

祝福我們!

I don't like failure, it always feels uncomfortable!

But failure is a good thing that pulls me back from the gap between illusion and reality

Many times I have too much imagination or illusion

In the process of trying, experience failure

Fortunately, after these failures, I realized there is such a big gap between illusion and reality.

And how many elements are missing from my strange illusion?

Despite the setbacks, it was a great experience

Through failure, recognize the illusion and avoid continuing to be in an illusion.

Of course, being in an illusion is not necessarily a bad thing. Having a comfortable immersion is also a great experience.

Failure can be an exit from illusion

If one day you feel that you are in an illusion, then look for the exit of failure!

Bless us to find the exit named failure when we are in the illusion

Bless us!
