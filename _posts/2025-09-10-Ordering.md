當我們去到一個陌生的國家，特別是語言不通的國家時，在餐廳點餐，難免就會鬧出些有趣的事情。

特別是看不懂菜單時，有些人選擇"盲點一排"，應該會命中一些食物吧!

有人在日本餐廳，在菜單上盲點一排，結果出了一堆湯。看來他是點到湯品區了! 冏!

有人在德國餐廳，在菜單上看到披薩的英文，接下來就看不懂了，想說盲點一排，應該也不會差太多。結果來了個7層披薩! 吃到後來吃不完了! 直接結帳離開!

When we visit an unfamiliar country, especially one where we don't speak the language, ordering at a restaurant can be a bit of a surprise.

Especially when we can't understand the menu, some people choose to "order a whole column of dishes" and hopefully find some food!

Someone at a Japanese restaurant "ordered a whole column of dishes" and got a bunch of soups. Apparently, they ordered from the soup section! Embarrassing!

Someone at a German restaurant saw the word "pizza" on the menu in English, then couldn't understand it. They thought "order a whole column of dishes" wouldn't make much difference. They ended up getting a 7-topping pizza! They couldn't finish it! They just paid and left!
