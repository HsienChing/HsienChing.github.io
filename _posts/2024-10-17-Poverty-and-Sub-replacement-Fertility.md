在這個貧富差距越來愈大的時代，

讓佔社會人口結構多數的窮人生不起小孩、養不起小孩，

少子化現象很自然就會發生，並成為嚴重的社會問題。

但你說能用那種很天真的一句話: "那是他們不肯努力!"

來解釋這狀況。

獻慶已經不是第一次聽到這個說法了。

但光這句話，就能解決問題嗎?!

數據會說話，如果這種問題只是"努力"就能解決，那十幾年來怎麼台灣生育率怎麼還會繼續下降呢。

畢竟沒有人會為了自己的生存而打混啊! 大家都很努力!

但問題就在那裏! 而且持續發生!

有沒有辦法實際降低貧窮狀況，也是會影響到生育問題。

當然問題不是只有貧窮這方面，許多學者的研究中，有看出更多複雜的狀況，但這些都不好解。

這可得有很長的路要走。

畢竟，我們都期望建立一個大家都負擔得起的社會，能夠順利生養下一代，看他們成長茁壯，走出自己的路!

祝福大家!

In this era when the gap between rich and poor is getting wider and wider,

Let the poor, who make up the majority of the society's population structure, be unable to have children or raise children.

The phenomenon of sub-replacement fertility will naturally occur and become a serious social problem.

But you can use that naive sentence: "That's because they are unwilling to work hard!"

to explain this situation.

This is not the first time I have heard this statement.

But can this sentence alone solve the problem?!

The data speaks for itself. If this kind of problem can be solved by just "hard work," then why has Taiwan's birthrate continued to decline over the past decade or so?

After all, no one will mess around for their survival! Everyone works hard!

But the problem is there! And it keeps happening!

Whether there is any way to reduce poverty will also affect sub-replacement fertility issues.

Of course, the problem is not limited to poverty. Many scholars have discovered more complex situations in their research, but these are not easy to explain.

This goes a long way.

After all, we all hope to build a society everyone can afford, where we can successfully raise the next generation and watch them grow up and make their way!

Blessings to all!
