2024-09-04 星期三 晚上

在74號快速道路行駛時。

後面的車輛突然閃大燈，平常要是遇到這個狀況，由於視線被強光干擾，為了安全，大概就是繼續開車吧。

但由於那台車沒有很頻繁閃大燈，不會嚴重干擾視線，才看到是一輛救護車。

那就趕快讓道囉!

附近的車輛，也很配合我改變車道，一切順利，讓救護車通過!

祝福救護車順利執行任務!

祝福!

While driving on Highway 74.

The car behind suddenly flashes its headlights. Normally, when I encounter this situation, because my vision is disturbed by the strong light, for the sake of safety, I will probably continue driving.

But because the car did not flash its headlights very frequently and would not seriously interfere with the line of sight, I saw that it was an ambulance.

Then get out of the way quickly!

The nearby cars also cooperated with me in changing lanes, and everything went smoothly, allowing the ambulance to pass!

Bless the ambulance a smooth mission!

bless!
