# 1. 論文資訊 (Article information)

**Title:** The Long-Term Usage of an Off-Grid Photovoltaic System with a Lithium-Ion Battery-Based Energy Storage System on High Mountains: A Case Study in Paiyun Lodge on Mt. Jade in Taiwan  
**Author:** Hsien-Ching Chung  
**Journal:** Batteries **10** (2024) 202  
**DOI:** [10.3390/batteries10060202](https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10060202)  
**Abstract:** Energy supply on high mountains remains an open issue since grid connection is not feasible. In the past, diesel generators with lead–acid battery energy storage systems (ESSs) were applied in most cases. Recently, photovoltaic (PV) systems with lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery ESSs have become suitable for solving this problem in a greener way. In 2016, an off-grid PV system with a Li-ion battery ESS was installed in Paiyun Lodge on Mt. Jade (the highest lodge in Taiwan). After operating for more than 7 years, the aging of the whole electric power system became a critical issue for its long-term usage. In this work, a method is established for analyzing the massive energy data (over 7 million rows), such as daily operation patterns, as well as the C-rate, temperature, and accumulated energy distributions, and estimating the health of the Li-ion battery system. A completed electric power improvement project dealing with power system aging is reported. Based on the long-term usage experience, a simple cost analysis model comparing lead–acid and Li-ion battery systems is built, revealing that expensive Li-ion batteries can compete with cheap lead–acid batteries for long-term usage on high mountains. This case study can provide engineers and researchers with a fundamental understanding of the long-term usage of off-grid PV ESSs and engineering on high mountains.

**題目:** 離網型太陽能系統與鋰離子電池儲能系統於高山上的長期使用: 台灣玉山排雲山莊案例研究  
**作者:** 鍾獻慶  
**期刊:** 電池 **10** (2024) 202  
**DOI:** [10.3390/batteries10060202](https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10060202)  
**摘要:** 由於電網連接困難，高山上的能源供應仍然是一個懸而未決的問題。過去，大多數情況下採用鉛酸電池儲能系統(ESS)加上柴油發電機。最近，採用鋰離子(Li-ion)電池的ESS的太陽能(PV)系統已經可以用更環保的方式解決這個問題。2016年，玉山排雲山莊(台灣最高山莊)安裝了鋰離子電池ESS的離網型太陽能系統。運作7年多後，整個電力系統的老化成為長期使用的關鍵問題。在這項工作中，建立了一種方法來分析能源大數據(超過700萬筆)，例如日常運行模式，以及C率、溫度和累積能量分佈，並評估鋰離子電池系統的健康狀況。本文同時對處理電力系統老化問題，提出電力系統改善計畫及完整的處理報告。根據長期使用經驗，建立了一個簡單的鉛酸和鋰離子電池系統成本分析模型，揭示了昂貴的鋰離子電池可以與廉價的鉛酸電池競爭在高山上的長期使用。此案例研究可以讓工程師和研究人員對離網型太陽能ESS的長期使用和其高山工程有基本的了解。

# 4. 總結 (Summary)

想要了解一篇學術文章在發表後，對世界影響的狀況，其實不太容易。

這次也只能僅憑一些資料庫、新聞等了解狀況。而且耗費了相當多的時間去看。

It is actually not easy to understand the impact of an academic article on the world after it is published.

This time we can only understand the situation based on some databases, news, etc. And it took quite a lot of time to watch.
