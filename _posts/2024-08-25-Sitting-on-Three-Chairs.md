小朋友在圖書館，一次坐兩個椅子，坐著坐著，就從中間滑下來了。

媽媽看了，當然不開心，便禁止他一次坐兩個椅子。

你也知道，小朋友就是，越禁越要做!

做爸爸當然要打開他的可能性，就說: "你可以試試看一次坐三個椅子!"

The child was sitting on two chairs at a time in the library. As he sat, he slipped from the middle.

When his mother saw it, she was certainly not happy, so she forbade him to sit on two chairs at a time.

You also know that for children, the more forbidden, the more they want to do!

Of course, as a father, I should open up his possibilities and say: "You can try sitting on three chairs at once!"
