長輩說她的手機怎麼會亂打電話。

電信公司跟她說，她每個月都會有一堆打到外面的電話。

她回來看一看，發現有的還打去美國。

那我們就開始偵探遊戲。

看電話號碼收發紀錄，用Google查詢電話號碼，發現都是當地的商家。

加上綜合長輩使用手機的習慣，大量地刷Facebook。

合理懷疑，是在刷Facebook文章時，手指誤觸當地的商家投放在Facebook廣告中的電話號碼，而造成自動撥號。

而打去美國這件事，事實則是與描述顛倒。

從收發紀錄來看，應該是收到美國的來電，而不是打出去。

推測是詐騙集團要來騙老人，打過來的。

好了，偵探遊戲結束。

老魔手，也是很厲害的!

The elder asked why her mobile phone was making random calls.

The telecommunications company told her that she got a lot of outbound calls in the past few months.

When she came back to take a look, she found that some of them were even sent to the United States.

Then let's start the detective game.

After looking at the phone number sending and receiving records and using Google to check the phone numbers, I found that they were all local businesses.

In addition, combined with the elder's habit of using mobile phones, she checks Facebook a lot.

It is reasonable to suspect that while browsing Facebook posts, her finger accidentally touched the phone number posted by a local business in a Facebook advertisement, causing automatic dialing.

In the matter of calling the United States, the facts are contrary to the description.

Judging from the sending and receiving records, it should be an incoming call from the United States, not an outgoing call.

It is speculated that the fraud group came to defraud the elderly and called them.

Well, the detective game is over.

The old magic hand is also very powerful!
