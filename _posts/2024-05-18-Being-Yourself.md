"當自己"  
這件事，  
並不  
容易。

我們  
會害怕  
顯露出  
自己，  
有可能  
是怕  
社會  
不接受。

但  
很多  
時候，  
真的  
不用  
害怕  
當自己。

畢竟，  
在這  
忙碌  
的  
社會，  
根本  
沒人  
有時間去  
管你  
是誰。

如果  
還對  
自己  
綁手  
綁腳，  
啥事  
都做不出來，  
那真  
的是  
耍蠢了。

而且  
就算  
啥事  
都做不出來，  
仍然  
得面對  
社會  
給的  
挑戰。

害怕  
太多，  
只會  
無法  
前進。

"Being yourself"  
is  
not  
easy.

We may be  
afraid of  
revealing ourselves,  
perhaps because  
we are afraid that  
society  
will not  
accept us.

But  
many times,  
you  
really don't  
have to  
be afraid of  
being yourself.

After all,  
in this  
busy  
society,  
no one  
has time  
to cares  
who  
you  
are.

If you still  
tie your hands and feet  
and  
can't  
do  
anything,  
then  
you are  
really being  
stupid.

And even  
if you  
can't  
accomplish  
anything,  
you still  
have to  
face challenges  
from society.

If you are  
too afraid,  
you will not  
be able to  
move forward.
