還記得國中時期，有位年輕的理化老師，總喜歡自己改題目，或設計新的題目。

導致他的題目，在學生們的感覺就是刁鑽、難搞!

不過這位老師有著開放的心，他總是會在與全班同學檢討考題時，詢問有沒有問題。

這時，同學們就會，提出問題。

大多數的狀況下，透過這樣的雙方討論，同學們會比較理解老師的想法。

而少數狀況，就會發現題目答案計算錯誤、或者題目的說明有狀況。

這時候就是，分數大放送的開心點!

而老師對於學生能發現問題，表情也是滿臉笑容!

祝福我們都能碰見，會出錯題目，且承認錯誤的好老師!

祝福我們!

I still remember that when I was in junior high school, there was a young physics and chemistry teacher who always liked to modify the questions himself or design new questions.

As a result, his questions seemed tricky and difficult to answer to students.

However, this teacher had an open mind and would always ask if there were any questions when reviewing the test questions with the whole class.

At this time, the students will ask questions.

In most cases, through such bidirectional discussions, students will better understand the teacher's ideas.

In a few cases, we may find that the answer to a question is calculated incorrectly or there is something wrong with the explanation of the question.

This is the time to have fun with the big points giveaway!

The teacher was also very happy when the students found the problem!

I wish we could all meet good teachers who can answer questions wrong and admit their mistakes!

Bless us!
