2024-07-28 星期日

星期日早上，我去商店買東西，結帳時跟店員討論商品。

兩人都眼神黯淡，顯然精神都不在線上，有一搭沒一搭的說著。

雙方都覺得對方不在線，就斷線了。

站在客人的立場，會覺得店員服務態度不佳。

但思考到，星期日還來工作，大概也是心情不佳的原因。

站在店員的立場，客人來討論，但我正在處理收銀機，不想理他。

沒人錯，只是雙方的精神，跟接觸時間不恰當。

祝福我們都回復比較好的精神狀態! 把生活過好!

2024-07-28 Sunday

On Sunday morning, I went to the store to buy something and discussed the items with the clerk at checkout.

Both of us had dim eyes, and we were not mentally focused, and we were talking about each other.

We both felt the other one was not online, so we disconnected.

From the customer's perspective, I felt the clerk's service attitude was poor.

But when I think about it, coming to work on Sunday is probably why she was in a bad mood.

From the clerk's point of view, the customer came to discuss, but I was working on the cash register and didn't want to pay attention to him.

No one was wrong, it was just that the spirit of both was inappropriate for the time of contact.

I wish we all get back to a better mental state! Live a good life!
