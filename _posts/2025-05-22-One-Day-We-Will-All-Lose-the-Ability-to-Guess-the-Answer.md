一件單純的手機重新開機事情

耗費了大量的人力成本，到達長輩家，才幫長輩完成手機重新開機

讓我意識到生命中的許多高成本小事情，正在嚴重消耗我們的生命

這裡充滿著無奈!

但另一個想法又進到腦中

我們有一天都會失去猜答案的能力，變成需要幫忙的長輩

祝福我們!

A simple matter of restarting the smartphone

It took a lot of manpower to get to the elder's home to help him restart the smartphone.

It made me realize that many high-cost little things in life are seriously consuming our lives.

This is full of helplessness!

But another thought came into my mind.

One day we will all lose the ability to guess the answer and become elders who need help.

Bless us!
