將汽車放在外面，直接陽光曝曬

從早上10點到下午2點

陽光曝曬4小時候，悶熱到爆

準備開車，打開引擎，打開冷氣，先降降溫度

發現行車紀錄器的畫面是全黑，沒有顯示任何東西

而且12V的車用電源，也都不供電

難道是車用電腦熱到當機

原來汽車也會熱到中暑啊! ^_^

Place the car outside in direct sunlight.

From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

After being exposed to the sun for 4 hours, it was extremely hot.

Get ready to drive, turn on the engine, turn on the air conditioner, and lower the temperature first.

I found that the driving recorder screen was completely black and didn't show anything.

Moreover, the 12V car's power supply did not provide power either.

Could it be that the car computer was so hot that it crashed?

It turns out that cars can be so hot that they can cause heatstroke! ^_^
