車子並不是貴、馬力強，就好開。

有天在地下停車場，往上開時。

發現前面有台BMW的汽車，開到輪胎都冒出白煙了，還一直無法突破一個小上坡。

令跟在後面的其他人，捏了把冷汗。

看起來車主並不懂得如何使用大馬力的車。他可能覺得，用力踩油門，就會上去了吧!

但在這種狀況下，反而是要使用低速檔並放輕油門，讓輪胎盡量保持低轉速，以獲得最大靜摩擦力，來取得突破上坡的力量。

車子馬力強，很好，但也要懂得如何用。

祝福能正確並安全地使用車輛。

祝福!

A car doesn't need to be expensive or powerful to be easy to drive.

One day I was driving up in the underground parking lot.

I found a BMW car in front of me. The driver drove until white smoke came out of the tires, and it still couldn't break through a small uphill slope.

The others who followed the car broke into a cold sweat.

It looks like the driver doesn't know how to use a high-horsepower car. The driver may have thought that if he stepped on the accelerator harder, he would go up!

But in this situation, we need to use a low gear and lighten the accelerator to keep the tire speed as low as possible to obtain maximum static friction and gain the power to break through the uphill slope.

A car with strong horsepower is great, but we must also know how to use it.

Blessings to use the vehicle correctly and safely.

Bless!
