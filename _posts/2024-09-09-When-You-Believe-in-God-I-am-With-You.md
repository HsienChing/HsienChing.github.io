由於"神"的定義不見明確。

情感上，我相信也許有所謂的"神"存在。當然這本身就是件矛盾至極的事情，所以僅能說是"情感上"。

若我們將任何宗教看作人類設定的規則，而任何教會看作是人類的組織。

我們會發現，是人想要行神之事。至於與神有無關聯，無法證明。

這觀點有個好處，就是讓人有機會跳脫出，一些藉神之名行人之惡事的狀況。

偶爾思考一下人與神的關係，會比較健康歐!

攪動腦部的對話就這樣吧!

回到信仰方面

當你相信神時，我與你在一起!

祝福我們!

Because the definition of "God" is not clear.

Emotionally, I believe that there may be a so-called "God". Of course, this is an extremely contradictory thing in itself, so it can only be said to be "emotional."

If we regard any religion as rules set by humans and any kind of church as an organization of humans.

We will find that it is humans who want to do the works of God. As for whether it is related to God, it cannot be proven.

This view has the advantage of giving people the opportunity to escape from situations where people do evil things in the name of God.

It would be healthier to think about the relationship between humans and God occasionally!

That's it for the brain-stirring conversation!

Back to Faith

When you believe in God, I am with you!

Bless us!
