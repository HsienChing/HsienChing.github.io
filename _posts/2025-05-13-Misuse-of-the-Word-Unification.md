我們的國小老師蠻有趣。  
有次在上課時討論 "統一" 這個這個詞。  
他說你們現在全班都在亂用 "統一" 這個詞。  
不是什麼東西都講 "統一" 就好。

一起行動就一起行動，搞什麼 "統一行動" !  
大家都有類似的行為，這是一個描述，幹嘛講 "統一行為" !

有時候，統一這個詞，已經濫用太嚴重了!  
這樣會干擾你們的思考!  
讓你們連自己在講什麼都搞不清楚!

總之要想清楚自己想要表達的是什麼意思!  
而不是全部都加上個 "統一" 就搞定了!

統一玩!  
統一笑!  
統一哭!

統一不見得是全對!  
長得一樣不是長得統一!  
看起來很像，就叫看起來很像，不是看起來很統一!

難得碰到老師，語重心長，跟我們討論 "統一" 這個詞的濫用，並讓我們重新去思考如何說話。

祝福我們能合理使用 "統一" 一詞，並重新思考平常說話的內容!

祝福我們!

Our elementary school teacher is quite interesting.  
One time during class, we were discussing the word "unification."
He said that you all in the class are using the word "unification" indiscriminately.
Not everything can be unified.

Let's act together. It's not "unified action?"
Everyone has similar behavior; this is a description, why talk about "unified behavior!"

Sometimes, the word "unification" has been abused too much!
This will disrupt your thinking!
You won't even know what you are talking about!

Anyway, you have to think clearly about what you want to express!
Instead of just adding "unification" to everything!

Unified playing!
Unified laughing!
Unified crying!

Unification is not necessarily all right!
Looking the same does not mean looking unified!
Looks alike means looks alike, not looks unified!

It's a rare opportunity to meet a teacher who speaks to us earnestly and sincerely about the misuse of the word "unification" and makes us rethink how to speak.

May we all use the word "unification" wisely and rethink what we say in our daily lives!

Bless us!
