生命的逝去，往往在不經意間!

許久不見面的朋友，突然有天聽到別人說起他的消息時，已經是，離開世界已久!

我們之間見面的記憶，彷彿在昨日，但也定格在了昨日!

還能怎麼說!

祝福一路好走!

祝福你!

The passing of life often happens inadvertently!

A friend whom you haven't seen for a long time, when you suddenly hear someone talking about him one day, he has already left this world for a long time!

The memory of our meeting seems like yesterday, but it is also frozen in yesterday!

What else can I say!

Wishing you a peaceful journey!

Bless you!
