降低等級去與實力弱很多的選手比賽，而拿獎牌，取得榮耀。

如果符合規則，當然這是一個合理的手段，而結果也是令人開心的一件事。

不過，當家長想盡辦法把小朋友看起來像是個天才，技巧性的天才。

而小朋友不知道狀況，還誤認為自己真的是天才。

那就是噩夢的開始。

到了真正的大場面，往往就是會聽到家長講著"我小朋友平常很厲害，這次只是失常了!"

但事實是，一但到大場面就失常。

那才叫正常啦!

技巧性獲得的榮耀，沒什麼不好。

只是人們得確實地認知自己的狀況，別被技巧性獲得的榮耀催眠，而錯估自己本身的實力。

祝福這些小朋友，當有天面對真實的自己時，也許會有點小崩潰，但也能繼續站起來，為自己的夢想而奮鬥!

祝福他們!

Lower your level to compete with much weaker players, and get medals and glory.

If it complies with the rules, of course, this is a reasonable means, and the result is also a happy thing.

However, when parents try their best to make their children look like a genius, a technical genius.

The children did not know the situation and mistakenly thought that they were real geniuses.

That was the beginning of the nightmare.

When it comes to really big events, you will often hear parents say, "My child is usually very good, but this time he is just abnormal!"

But the fact is, once you get to a big event and you become abnormal. 

That's normal!

There is nothing wrong with the glory gained through skill.

It's just that we have to truly understand our situation, and don't be hypnotized by the glory gained through skill and misestimate our strength.

---

I wish these children that when they face their true selves one day, they may collapse a little, but they can continue to stand up and fight for their dreams!

Bless them!
