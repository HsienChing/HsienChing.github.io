我這個人，想事情時，常常發呆，看起來就呆呆的。

不想事情時，也是放空，看起來還是呆呆的。

我記得國中時，理化常常考滿分。

有同學就來問，如何做到?

一開始講說: "要理解內容，多做練習，就會滿分。"

但看著他們不可置信的眼神，不願接受的表情。

久而久之，我就改說: "是運氣好啦!"

他們的表情就"放下了!"

也許他們不願接受"呆呆也考滿分!"

哈!

看來人會選擇自己認為的 "真相"!

後來，這種事，在我的生命中不斷發生!

我也難以解釋太多!

也許，我這個人就是運氣好!

無論真相如何!

你們相信就好!

運氣確實是成功的要素之一!

祝福我們的運氣都很好!

祝福大家!

I am a person who is often in a daze when I am thinking about things, and I look dull.

When I don't think about things, I feel empty and still look dull.

In junior high school, I often got full marks in physics and chemistry.

Some classmates came and asked, how to do it?

At the beginning, I said: "You must understand the content and practice more, and you will get perfect scores."

But looking at their disbelieving eyes and unwillingness to accept it.

Over time, I changed my mind and said, "It's just luck!"

Their expressions were "let go!"

Maybe they don't want to accept "I can get perfect marks even if I look stupid!"

Ha!

It seems that people will choose what they think is the "truth!"

Later, this kind of thing kept happening in my life!

I'm too hard to explain in detail!

Perhaps, I am just lucky!

No matter what the truth is!

Just believe it!

Luck is indeed an element of success!

Wish us all good luck!

Blessings to all!
