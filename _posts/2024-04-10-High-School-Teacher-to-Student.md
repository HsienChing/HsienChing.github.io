高中老師:  
"你這次  
物理  
考100，  

但  
我們學校  
歷年來  
沒人  
考100，  

這樣  
很奇怪。  

我看  
就改成  
99好了。  

把這個  
"9"  
看成  
"q"，  

扣你  
一分，  

這樣  
OK吧!"  

學生: "..."

High school teacher:  
"You got a score of  
100 in physics  
this time.

But  
no one in our school  
has passed  
100  
in the past years.

This is  
very strange.

I think  
it would be better  
to change it to 99.

Think of this  
"9"  
as  
"q",

I'll deduct  
one point from you.

That's  
OK!"

Student: "..."
