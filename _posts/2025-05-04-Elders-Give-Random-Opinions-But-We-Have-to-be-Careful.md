長輩之前說，有人擔任公務員，對於薪水不滿足，於是下班後，做盲盒生意，這份兼差賺很多錢。一邊講著這個故事，一邊說這個人很厲害，他很欽佩，也希望晚輩們能向他看齊。

"他賣盲盒公仔大賺700萬元 被國稅局抓到補稅52萬"

但過沒幾天，我就看到這個新聞。

看來，不是說有些"聰明"，就可以隨便兼差幹些副業去"小發財"，不守規矩的話，也許是國稅局會"小發財"!

有些人可能會覺得自己從某寶進口A貨亂賣可以賺價差，但這其實已經危及到正常合法商家的經營，實在是"破壞市場"。

而且，現在稅務單位的監管都很嚴格，會不會就只賺一次，被發現後，全部吐回去，還到賠。而且說實在的，很多匯款手段，現在電腦都會監控，稅務單位指示在等你的交易量能達到他的業績後，才要抓。就是所謂的"魚要養大、豬要養肥"。

另外，資本規模太小，賺太少還不如不要賺，累的。除非只是想累積銷售經驗，那另當別論。

只想到賺錢沒看到法規還有風險，可能賠掉更多。

這就是為什麼正常店家、正常管道、就要投入那麼多資本，獲利也就那樣。

長輩當然可以隨便提意見，但我們得審慎考慮，小心行動!

不然長輩只講了幾分鐘，我們卻得賠掉好幾年! 還會留下不光明的紀錄!

---

祝福我們能謹慎思考長輩提供的意見!

祝福我們!

(這個新聞是銷售額700萬，補稅52萬，所以他補完稅後，算上自己的經營成本跟時間，應該是賠了。不是銷售利潤700萬，補稅52萬，有的人可能會以為這樣補完稅他還賺648萬，錯!)

The elders said that a person who worked as a civil servant was not satisfied with his salary, so he started a blind box business after get off work. This part-time job made a lot of money. While telling this story, he said that this man was very powerful, he admired him very much, and hoped that the younger generations could emulate him.

---

"He made huge sales of 200,000 USD selling blind box dolls, but was caught by the IRS and paid 15,000 USD in taxes."

But a few days later, I saw the news.

It seems that if you are "smart," you can just do some side jobs to "make a small fortune." However, if you don't follow the rules, maybe the IRS will "make a small fortune!"

Some people may think that they can make a profit by importing goods and selling them indiscriminately, but this has actually endangered the operations of legal merchants and is really "destroying the market."

Moreover, the supervision of the tax authorities is very strict now. Will we only make money once, and when we are discovered, we will spit it all back and we will be compensated. To be honest, many remittance methods are now monitored by computers, and the tax authorities are instructed to wait until their transaction volume reaches their performance before arresting them. It is the so-called "fish must be raised and pigs must be fattened."

In addition, the capital scale is too small, and if we make too little money, it is better not to make any money at all, which is tiring. Unless we just want to gain sales experience, that's another story.

Just thinking about making money without seeing the regulations and risks, we might lose more.

This is why normal legal stores and channels have to invest so much capital and only make a not-so-much profit.

---

Of course, elders can give opinions freely, but we must consider and act carefully!

Otherwise, the elders only spoke for a few minutes, but we would have lost several years! There would also be a bad record left!

---

Bless us to carefully consider the opinions provided by our elders!

Bless us!
