進山洞

光線由全亮變全黑  
眼睛整個就是瞎掉的狀態

而且剛進山洞，就是一個轉彎  
如果車速太快，就是直接撞上

在黑黑的山洞  
打開大燈前行

偶而也會有驚喜  
碰到大台怪手正在做工程

打個招呼後  
怪手調整一個姿勢  
將手臂彎出一個弧形洞  
讓小車車通過

很有趣

Enter the cave

The light changes from full brightness to full black  
My eyes are completely blind

And as soon as we enter the cave, we make a turn  
If the speed is too fast, it will hit directly

In the dark cave  
Turn on the headlights and move forward

Occasionally there will be surprises  
I met a giant excavator who was working

After saying hello  
The excavator adjusts a posture  
Make the arm as a curved hole  
Let the small cars pass

very funny
