不要把別人的成功看成沒有什麼!

運動選手、音樂家、歌手等人的成功，裡面投入的資源是難以計算的，也是我們看不到的，也許有個人的努力，也許也有團隊的幫忙。

但要看到一個人或一群人往成功的努力，這件事情其實不容易，畢竟我們通常無感於他人成功背後的努力，直到我們真的自己也下手去做。

這是件很正常不過的事情，也沒啥不好意思!

當我們常常下手去做許多事情，而失敗後，就可體驗成功的不凡，進而擴大自己對世界的認知。

當我們能欣賞別人的成功時，也代表自身的水準也提升了一定的程度!

祝福我們能有能力去欣賞別人的成功!

Don't take other people's success for granted!

The resources invested in the success of athletes, musicians, singers, etc. are difficult to calculate and invisible to us. It may be the result of personal efforts and the help of a team.

But it is not easy to see the efforts of a person or a group of people toward success. After all, we are usually unaware of the efforts behind others' success until we really start to do it ourselves.

This is a very normal thing, nothing to be ashamed of!

When we often try to do many things and fail, we can experience extraordinary success and expand our understanding of the world.

When we can appreciate the success of others, it also means that our own level has been improved to a certain extent!

Bless we have the ability to appreciate the success of others!
