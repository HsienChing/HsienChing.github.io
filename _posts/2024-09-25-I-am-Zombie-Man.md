一早就被痛醒，發現右邊頸部僵硬，疼痛、動一下身體就痛。

看來是"落枕"了。

光起床就是一個大工程，要撐起身體都是大問題。

後來只能用最小幅度動作，慢慢起床。

之後的動作，也都是"慢動作"版本。

慢慢走路，像個"殭屍人"。

開車去公司、上班寫報告、開車下班...

只能坐在椅子上，慢慢移動雙手，搞作業!

一旦起來移動，又開始"殭屍人"模式。

感受了一整天的"殭屍人"痛苦，我想也夠了!

祝福明天會脫離"殭屍人"狀態。

祝福我!

I woke up early in the morning and found that the right side of my neck was stiff and painful, and it hurt whenever I moved my body.

It seems to be a "stiff neck."

Just getting out of bed was a big project, and holding the body up was a big problem.

Later, I could only use the smallest movements and get up slowly.

The subsequent actions were also in "slow motion" version.

Walk slowly, like a "Zombie Man."

Driving to the company, writing reports at work, driving to get off work...

I can only sit on the chair, move my hands slowly, and do my work!

Once up and moving, "Zombie Man" mode begins again.

After feeling the pain of "Zombie Man" for a whole day, I think it's enough!

I hope I will escape from the "Zombie Man" state tomorrow.

Bless me!
