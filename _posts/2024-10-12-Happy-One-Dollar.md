2024-10-12 星期六

假日出勤特派員，機密任務，幫全家買午餐。

去台中向上市場買完便當，碰到一個女生。

女生: "可以給我一元嗎?"

慶: "你要打電話嗎?"

女生: "不是啦!"

看她熊熊講不出來，我想，也許她是在玩什麼"社團的冒險遊戲"。

那就幫她一把，贊助一元! ^_^

女生: "先生謝謝你，你是個好人!"

值回票價啦! 真是開心的一元!

GOOD! ^_^

-續集-

下午1點半左右，出來買杯咖啡時，在五權西路跟美村路交接口，又碰到另一位女生，手上拿個小紙盒，裡面已經有幾元了。

女生: "可以給我一元嗎?"

慶: "我剛剛在向上市場碰到另一位啊!"

女生: "我們在自助旅行啦!"

-後記-

出來走走吧!

也許你也會巧遇"開心一元"!

2024-10-12 Saturday

Special correspondent on holiday, secret mission, buying lunch for the whole family.

After going to Taichung Siangshang Market to buy lunch boxes, I met a girl.

Girl: "Can you give me one dollar?"

Ching: "Do you want to call?"

Girl: "No!"

Seeing that she couldn't speak clearly, I thought maybe she was playing some "social adventure game."

Then I helped her and sponsored one dollar.

Girl: "Thank you, sir, you are a good person!"

It's worth the ticket price! What a happy one dollar!

GOOD! ^_^

-Sequel-

When I went out to buy a cup of coffee at about 1:30 p.m., I met another girl at the intersection of Wucyuan West Road and Meicun Road. She was holding a small paper box with a few dollars in it.

Girl: "Can you give me one dollar?"

Ching: "I just met another one at the Siangshang Market!"

Girl: "We are on a self-guided trip!"

-Afterwards-

Come out and take a walk!

Maybe you will also encounter "Happy One Dollar" by chance!
