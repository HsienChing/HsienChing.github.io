當我們對"神"做了一個明確的定義後，"神"就不"萬能"了。

當我們希望神是"萬能"時，就不要對"神"下明確的定義。

一旦明確化，就會有限制，有限制，就不"萬能"。

只有超越定義，才能保有"萬能"!

一個簡單的想法，就是不要指定"誰是神"，"什麼是神"

當講不清楚時，神就是萬能的!

When we have a clear definition of "God," "God" is no longer "almighty."

When we want God to be "almighty," we should not give a clear definition of "God."

Once it is made clear, there will be limitations, and if there are limitations, it will not be "almighty."

Only by transcending definition can we maintain "almighty!"

A simple idea is not to specify "who is God" and "what is God"

When it's unclear, God is almighty!
