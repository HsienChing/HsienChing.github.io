跟  
一位  
傳產  
公司  
女老闆，  
聊到  
家庭。

闆:  
"我小孩  
都說  
我毛  
很多，  
很難搞!  
怎麼  
會  
這樣!"

慶:  
"年輕人  
做事  
比較有  
"彈性"啦!  
而且  
一個  
成功  
人士，  
都有  
自己  
的  
特色，  
自然  
毛不  
會少!  
別太  
在意!"

I was  
chatting  
with  
a female boss  
of a company  
in traditional industry  
about family.

Boss:  
"My kids  
said  
I have  
many rules  
and it's difficult  
to handle!  
How could  
this happen!"

Ching:  
"Young people  
are more  
"flexible"  
in doing  
things!  
And  
a successful  
person  
has  
her own  
characteristics,  
so naturally  
she will  
have  
many rules!  
Don't care  
too much!"
