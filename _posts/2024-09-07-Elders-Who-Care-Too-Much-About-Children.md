2024年08月某日 早上

小朋友起床後，準備要去參加游泳比賽

小朋友開始吃早餐，才開始吃沒幾口

長輩: "吃太多，等一下會想吐歐!"

小朋友受到影響後，就不吃了

長輩: "不吃早餐，等一下沒有力氣歐!"

我在旁邊聽到都"冏"了!

這不就是經典的，做也錯，不做也錯!

那我們該如何做?!

標準的關心版"死亡迴圈"!

既然，小朋友已經體驗到了，就祝福他某天會走出這種"過度關心的死亡迴圈"吧!

其實"做也錯，不做也錯"的另一個跳脫式解讀就是"做也對，不做也對"

跳出的方式很多，找到自己的方法就行

祝福他某天被這種鳥式卡住時，懂得跳出來!

祝福他!

One morning in August 2024

After the child got up, he was ready to participate in the swimming competition.

The child started eating breakfast and only took a few bites.

Elder: "If you eat too much, you will feel like vomiting later!"

After the child was affected, he stopped eating.

Elder: "If you don't eat breakfast, you won't have the energy to wait!"

When I heard it next to me, I felt so strange!

Isn't this just a classic? It's wrong to do it, and it's also wrong not to do it!

What should we do?!

The standard caring version of "Death Circle!"

Now that the child has experienced it, I wish him the best that he will one day get out of this "death cycle of over-care!"

In fact, another interpretation of "It's wrong to do it, and it's also wrong not to do it" is "It's right to do it, and it's also right not to do it."

There are many ways to jump out, just find our own way.

I hope he knows how to jump out when he gets stuck in this bird pose one day!

Bless him!
