任何的事件的達成都是不容易的狀態。

在投入的資源不高的時候，要達成特定狀態，那就得要很多的運氣。

很多人可能會質疑，為何一般人無法成功!

例如: 我的小孩怎麼沒辦法像那個誰誰誰那樣成為世界第一?

也許該先問自己，為了這個小孩投入了多少資源，如果投入的不多，又想要世界第一，只是妄想。

除非有強大的運氣，但運氣只是暫時的。一個瞬間達到特定成功狀態是可能的，可以看做你上賭桌贏一局的概念，那叫賭客，但要長時間維持狀態就難囉，可以看做你十幾年在賭桌上都贏的概念，那叫賭神。時間一拖長，事情就會回到基本面，看整體投入資源的多寡。

當然也有另一種"突破盲點的方式"，就是看那個成為世界第一的小孩，他的父母跟整個社會為他投入了多少資源。通常都是會"嚇死人的"!

多看一些投入資源跟成果的案例，我們就不會失望於自己的失敗、或孩子的失敗。

反而會看到自己資源投入的不足。

以另一個角度來說，以我而言，我不會太在乎那一點因為運氣而獲得的成果，畢竟投入的資源，似乎太少!

祝福我繼續看透自己沒有足夠資源，但因運氣而達成事情!

對資源少的人而言，運氣真的太重要!

祝福每個人都有他的好運!

有好運的瞬間突破，也是生命的美好之一!

祝福大家!

The achievement of any event is not an easy state.

When the resources invested are not high, it will take a lot of luck to achieve a specific state.

Many people may question why ordinary people cannot succeed!

For example: Why can't my child become number one in the world like so-and-so?

Maybe we should first ask ourselves how many resources we have invested in this child. If we don't invest much, and we want the child to be number one in the world, it is just delusion.

Unless there is strong luck, but luck is only temporary. It is possible to reach a certain state of success in an instant. It can be seen as the concept of winning a round at the gambling table. That is called a gambler. However, it is difficult to maintain the state for a long time. It can be seen as the concept that you have been at the gambling table for more than ten years. The concept of winning is called the God of Gamblers. As time goes by, things will return to fundamentals, depending on the overall amount of resources invested.

Of course, there is another way to "break through blind spots," which is to look at the child who becomes number one in the world and how many resources his parents and the entire society have invested in him. It's usually "incredibly high!"

If we look at more cases where resources have been invested and results achieved, we will not be disappointed by our failures or the failures of our children.

On the contrary, we will see that our resource investment is insufficient.

From another perspective, as for me, I don't care too much about the results obtained due to luck. After all, the resources invested seem to be too few!

Bless me to continue to see that I don't have enough resources but to achieve things due to luck!

For people with few resources, luck is really important!

Wish everyone good luck!

A momentary breakthrough brought by good luck is also one of the beauties of life!

Blessings to all!
