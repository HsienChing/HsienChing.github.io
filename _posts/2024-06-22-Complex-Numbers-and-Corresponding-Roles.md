複數  
是個  
神奇  
的  
數學  
存在!

會  
相信  
它  
的  
存在，  
是  
學生、  
信眾。

會  
使用  
它  
的  
存在，  
是  
工程師、  
技師。

會  
發展  
它  
的  
存在，  
是  
研究員、  
科學家。

會  
懷疑  
並  
製造  
它  
的  
存在，  
是  
數學家、  
哲學家。

你問我，  
什麼  
時候，  
後面  
的  
角色  
會  
升級  
成  
"神"。

歐!  
那  
不是  
屬於  
人類  
的  
角色!

一邊  
開車，  
一邊  
聽著  
Joe Satriani  
的  
曲子  
Light Years Away，  
來了些  
靈感!

<!--
2024-05-09 下班途中，在74號快速道路上開車回台中時，突然的靈感!

Joe Satriani自己出來講解曲子。

> Next step is a song called "Light Years Away" It's the first single from the album. And this song is really about traveling. Some place light years away. Some place you're really trying to get to. And I wanna this heavy groove to really reflect the journey. So the arrangement is long. The album version is quite a bit longer than the single edit. And in this way, I felt the riffs got heavier, and then everyone performed sort of cooked and cooked, until got hotter and hotter to the end. Something I really wanna to happen. So as the song starts with the keyboard just bubbling up, and the band kicks in with a heavy groove. The song is a real rocker. And this is a lot of fun to do in the studio. It wasn't too difficult to do, because everyone is so excited about the heavy groove. And just a little locking as a tight light band. And giving a real essential performance for the recording. Anyway, this one is called light years away. Check it out!

Complex  
numbers  
are  
a magical  
mathematical  
existence!

Those who  
believe  
in its  
existence  
are  
students  
and  
believers.

Those who  
can  
use  
it  
are  
engineers  
and  
technicians.

Those who  
will  
develop  
its existence  
are  
researchers  
and  
scientists.

Those who  
doubt  
and  
create  
its  
existence  
are  
mathematicians  
and  
philosophers.

You ask me,  
when  
will  
the  
subsequent  
characters  
be  
upgraded  
to  
"gods".

Oh!  
That  
is  
not  
a  
human  
character!

While driving,  
I  
listened to  
Joe Satriani's  
song  
ight Years Away  
and  
got  
some  
inspiration!
