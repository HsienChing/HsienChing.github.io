複數  
是個  
神奇  
的  
數學  
存在!

會  
相信  
它  
的  
存在，  
是  
學生、  
信眾。

會  
使用  
它  
的  
存在，  
是  
工程師、  
技師。

會  
發展  
它  
的  
存在，  
是  
研究員、  
科學家。

會  
懷疑  
並  
製造  
它  
的  
存在，  
是  
數學家、  
哲學家。

你問我，  
什麼  
時候，  
後面  
的  
角色  
會  
升級  
成  
"神"。

歐!  
那  
不是  
屬於  
人類  
的  
角色!

一邊  
開車，  
一邊  
聽著  
Joe Satriani  
的  
曲子  
Light Years Away，  
來了些  
靈感!

<!--

Joe Satriani自己出來講解曲子。

> Next step is a song called "Light Years Away" It's the first single from the album. And this song is really about traveling. Some place light years away. Some place you're really trying to get to. And I wanna this heavy groove to really reflect the journey. So the arrangement is long. The album version is quite a bit longer than the single edit. And in this way, I felt the riffs got heavier, and then everyone performed sort of cooked and cooked, until got hotter and hotter to the end. Something I really wanna to happen. So as the song starts with the keyboard just bubbling up, and the band kicks in with a heavy groove. The song is a real rocker. And this is a lot of fun to do in the studio. It wasn't too difficult to do, because everyone is so excited about the heavy groove. And just a little locking as a tight light band. And giving a real essential performance for the recording. Anyway, this one is called light years away. Check it out!

(這段英文是獻慶，聽了幾遍後，跟著寫出來。不見得百分百抓到Joe Satriani講什麼。)

中文翻譯:  
> 下一步是一首名為"Light Years Away"的歌曲，這是專輯中的第一首單曲。這首歌其實是關於旅行的。有些地方遠在數光年之外。某個你真正想去的地方。我希望這種沉重的節奏能真正反映這段旅程。所以安排時間很長。專輯版本比單曲版本長很多。就這樣，我感覺連複段變得更重了，然後每個人都表演得越來越熱，直到最後越來越熱。我真的很想發生一些事情。因此，當歌曲開始時，鍵盤上的聲音響起，樂團以沉重的節奏開始演奏。這首歌是一首真正的搖滾歌曲。在工作室裡做這件事很有趣。做起來並不太難，因為每個人都對沉重的節奏感到非常興奮。只需一點點鎖定即可形成緊密的輕型樂團。並為錄音提供真正必要的表演。反正這叫"Light Years Away"。一探究竟！

(這段是中文是，直接英翻中，有些口語英文直翻，就會比較沒有文章的通順感。但大致上了解Joe Satriani想要表達什麼就好。)

Complex  
numbers  
are  
a magical  
mathematical  
existence!

Those who  
believe  
in its  
existence  
are  
students  
and  
believers.

Those who  
can  
use  
it  
are  
engineers  
and  
technicians.

Those who  
will  
develop  
its existence  
are  
researchers  
and  
scientists.

Those who  
doubt  
and  
create  
its  
existence  
are  
mathematicians  
and  
philosophers.

You ask me,  
when  
will  
the  
subsequent  
characters  
be  
upgraded  
to  
"gods".

Oh!  
That  
is  
not  
a  
human  
character!

While driving,  
I  
listened to  
Joe Satriani's  
song  
ight Years Away  
and  
got  
some  
inspiration!
