阿嬤: "我最近發現附近有一間店，你去幫我買一下蝦餅。"

孫子: "那間店長怎樣?"

阿嬤: "就是有紅色招牌，上面寫蝦什麼店到店。"

孫子: "蝦皮店到店。"

備註: 
1. 蝦皮店到店是網路購物的貨物收送點。
2. "蝦皮"跟"蝦子"的蝦是同音。

Grandma: "I recently found a shop nearby. Please go buy some shrimp chips for me."

Grandson: "How does that shop look like?"

Grandma: "There is a red signboard that says shrimp blah blah."

Grandson: "Shopee shop-to-shop."

NOTE: 
1. "Shopee shop-to-shop" is a collection and delivery point for online shopping. No shrimp chips are sold.
2. The sounds of "Shopee" and "shrimp" in Taiwanese are almost identical.
