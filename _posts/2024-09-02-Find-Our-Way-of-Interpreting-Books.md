有人覺得，我讀了一個博士，應該看了很多書，很多文章。

其實我這輩子很少完整看懂書跟文章，而且是第一次看就看懂。

看文章是需要高度集中力、高知識、高技術、費體力的工作。

我很少直接看懂。

但我最後怎麼懂一些書中的知識呢?

幾乎都是靠實做去理解文字描述的東西。

直接去做，才慢慢理解文字描述的內容。

當然這個過程很痛苦，也消耗很多時間。有時也會發現書或文章少了許多資訊，或者就是寫錯了。

雖然痛苦，但回想起來，卻也是個有趣的過程。

後來自己也寫書跟文章，才發現不可能把資料完整呈現，這種內容是不存在的。

也就是寫書的人，註定寫不完整。而看書的人，也只能用自己的經驗去解讀不完整的內容，去完整自己的想法!

祝福我們都找到自己解讀書的方式!

祝福我們!

Some people think that as a doctor, I should have read many books and articles.

In fact, I rarely fully understand books and articles in my life, especially when I read them for the first time.

Reading articles is a task that requires high concentration, high knowledge, high technology, and physical strength.

I rarely understand directly.

But how did I finally understand some of the knowledge in the book?

Almost all of them rely on actual practice to understand what is described in the text.

Only by doing it directly can I slowly understand the content described in the text.

Of course, this process is painful and takes a lot of time. Sometimes we will find that a book or article is missing a lot of information, or it is written incorrectly.

Although painful, looking back, it was also an interesting process.

Later, I also wrote books and articles, and then I realized that it was impossible to present the information completely. This kind of content did not exist.

In other words, people who write books are destined to write incompletely. And readers can only use their own experience to interpret the incomplete content and complete their ideas!

Bless us all to find our way of interpreting books!

Bless us!
