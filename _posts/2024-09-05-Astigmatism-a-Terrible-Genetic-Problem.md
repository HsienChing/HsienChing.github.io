散光，造成視力模糊，主要原因從物理來看是角膜形狀出了問題，原本要球面形狀的角膜，經檢查後，發現趨近蛋型或不規則狀，那散光可嚴重了。從物理古典光學的角度來看散光這件事，相對單純。

另外的主因，竟然是基因。這就令人意外，這表示散光具備遺傳性因素，是個遺傳問題，或是遺傳疾病。(這種研究不容易做，因此學界仍有討論空間，可以肯定的部分是，有看到遺傳性的現象)

可怕在於大多數人並不知道散光是遺傳問題時，往往會把責任歸咎於個人行為問題。

像我，從小被家長罵到大: "為什麼要這麼近看電視，這麼近看書"。這樣的家庭環境，人的心理壓力都很大，沒事都變有事了。

我小時候，家長也不知道，眼睛問題是可以去看醫生處理。

當我視力模糊時，只會帶去眼鏡行配眼鏡，而當時的眼鏡行也沒有什麼證照制度，簡單講就是"土師傅"，散光當近視處理，自然眼鏡度數是越戴越大。

然後，家長就繼續罵: "為什麼要這麼近看電視，這麼近看書，電動玩具打那麼久，一天到晚揉眼睛"。這樣的家庭環境，人的心理壓力都很大，沒事都變有事了。

罵沒有用，總之眼鏡度數就是慢慢增加，在罵了十幾年後，換了十幾次眼鏡後，就穩定在一個眼鏡度數數值了。而眼睛也已經很多東西都看不清楚了。

那我怎麼知道散光是遺傳性問題?

有一天，學校通知我，小朋友有散光，需要帶去眼科，給醫師進行進一步檢查跟處理。

從這天開始，我才開始了解什麼叫散光。也才發現到散光的遺傳性。

醫生也說，台灣的教育方式，造成小朋友在小學階段就大量使用眼睛，寫字讀書，造成眼睛傷害。電視反而不是主要因素。

目前來說，每天睡前要點散瞳劑，白天使用眼睛時，要搭配散光眼鏡。這樣持續矯正十年左右。繼續滾動式調整處理。

可以說，很多謎團都解開了!

儘管是遺傳性問題，但現代醫學有他的解法，儘管無法完全解決，但看起來是目前最佳解，那就使用這個解法囉!

而過去家長罵了十幾年，也就這樣囉! 畢竟人們在沒辦法時，罵是最直接簡單的方法。儘管方向錯誤了，但總之大家都活過來了，無奈之舉啊! 也就這樣吧!

最起碼，散光這個可怕的遺傳症狀，在我這個世代被辨識出，而在我兒子這個世代開始正面處理。

祝福小朋友能與散光這個遺傳問題，和平相處!

祝福他!

Astigmatism causes blurred vision. From a physical point of view, the main reason is that there is a problem with the shape of the cornea. After examination, the cornea, which was originally supposed to be spherical, is found to be egg-shaped or irregular-shaped, and the astigmatism is serious. From the perspective of physical classical optics, astigmatism is relatively simple.

The other main reason turned out to be genes. This is surprising, and it means that astigmatism has hereditary factors, is a genetic problem, or a genetic disease. (This kind of research is not easy to do, so there are still many issues for discussion in the academic community. What is certain is that hereditary phenomena have been seen.)

The scary thing is that when most people don't know that astigmatism is a genetic problem, they tend to blame personal behavioral issues.

Like me, I have been scolded by my parents since childhood. "Why do you watch TV and read books so close!" In such a family environment, people's psychological pressure is very high, and everything becomes troublesome.

When I was a child, my parents didn't know that eye problems could be dealt with by going to the doctor.

When my vision was blurred, I would only take it to an optical shop to get glasses. At that time, the optical shop did not have any licensing system. Simply put, they were "local masters." Astigmatism was treated as myopia, and the prescription of glasses naturally increased the more I wore them.

Then, the parents continued to scold me. "Why you had to watch TV so close, read so close, play video games for so long, and rub your eyes all day long." In such a family environment, people's psychological pressure is very high, and everything becomes troublesome.

There is no point in scolding. In short, the prescription of my glasses is slowly increasing. After more than ten years of scolding and changing my glasses more than ten times, the prescription of my glasses has stabilized at a stable value. And my eyes can no longer see things clearly.

So how do I know that astigmatism is a hereditary problem?

One day, the school informed me that my child had astigmatism and needed to be taken to an ophthalmologist for further examination and treatment.

From this day on, I began to understand what astigmatism is. Then I discover the hereditary nature of astigmatism.

Doctors also said that Taiwan's education method causes children to use their eyes extensively for writing and reading in elementary school, causing eye damage quickly. Television is not the main factor.

Currently, my child needs to take mydriatic before going to bed every day, and wear astigmatism glasses when using his eyes during the day. This correction continued for about ten years. Continue the rolling adjustment process.

It can be said that many mysteries have been solved!

Although it is a hereditary problem, modern medicine has its solution. Although it cannot be completely solved, it seems to be the best solution at present, so use this solution!

In the past, parents have been scolding for more than ten years, and that's it! After all, when people have no other choice, scolding is the most direct and simple way. Even the direction was wrong, everyone survived anyway. It was a helpless move! That's it!

At the very least, this terrible genetic astigmatism problem was recognized in my generation and started to be dealt with head-on in my son's generation.

I wish my child could live in peace with the genetic problem of astigmatism!

Bless him!
