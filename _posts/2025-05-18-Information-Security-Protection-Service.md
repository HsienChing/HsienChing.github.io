某天很意外地，接到高雄中華電信，說要不要購買資安防護服務。

慶: "我這裡是台中。應該是台中的中華電信打來啊! 怎麼是高雄那邊打過來?"

信: "有時候會跨區招生易啦!"

...

結束通話後，我在想，對資訊工程的人而言，常常都要穿越資訊安全的防火牆去作業。

常常就是要脫下防護衣往火裡跳的意思，那購買"資安防護服務"這樣的防護衣，到底意義在哪!

One day, unexpectedly, I received a call from Chunghwa Telecom in Kaohsiung asking if I wanted to purchase information security services.

Chung: "This is Taichung. It should be the call from Chunghwa Telecom in Taichung! Why is it from Kaohsiung?"

Chunghwa: "Sometimes cross-district enrollment will be easy!"

...

After the call ended, I was thinking that for information engineering people, we often have to go through the information security firewall to work.

Often it just means taking off our protective clothing and jumping into the fire. So what is the point of buying protective clothing like "Information Security Protection Service!"
