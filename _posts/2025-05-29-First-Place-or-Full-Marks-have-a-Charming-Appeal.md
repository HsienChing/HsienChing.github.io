在一個競爭的社會中，第一名或滿分有著的迷人魅力。

就是這迷人魅力，讓許多人付出時間與各式代價去爭取。

不過，有時候，我們也得停下來，思考一下這 "第一名或滿分" 代表的意思。是否值得追求。

例如: 
在一場考試中，有大量的錯誤題目。
儘管評鑑單位，確實能列出第一名，但這代表什麼!

或者，在一場競賽中，有不公平狀況。
儘管評鑑單位，確實能列出第一名，但這代表什麼!

或者，在一場認證測試中，僅要求超過基準值。
那獲取滿分，則會投入大量時間及資源，會不會對個人生活的其他方面，有負面影響!


其實只要妥善規範，我們每個人，常常都在拿第一名。

只要把範圍條件限制到只剩下一個人，那個人就是當然第一名!

例如:
在這個地點、在這時間點，就只有你一人在呼吸，那你就是第一名!


在脫離第一名的迷人魅力後，我們的生命將會改變!

將會看到生命中更有價值的一面!

至於那是什麼!

就留給我們自己去發現了!

祝福我們!

In a competitive society, first place or full marks have a charming appeal.

It is this fascinating charm that makes many people spend their time and pay various prices to strive for it.

However, sometimes we have to stop and think about what "first place or full marks" means. Is it worth pursuing?

For example: 
In an exam, there are a large number of wrong questions.
Although the evaluation unit can indeed list the first place, what does this mean?

Or, in a competition, there is an unfair situation.
Although the evaluation unit can indeed list the first place, what does this mean?

Or, in a certification test, only exceeding the benchmark value is required.
If you want to get full marks, you will have to invest a lot of time and resources. Will it have a negative impact on other aspects of your life?


In fact, as long as we regulate properly, each of us can often get the first place.

As long as you limit the scope to only one person, that person will be the first place!

For example:
At this place and at this time, you are the only one breathing, then you are the first!


Our lives will change after we are freed from the allure of first place!

You will see the more valuable side of life!

As for what that is!

It's left for us to discover!

Bless us!
