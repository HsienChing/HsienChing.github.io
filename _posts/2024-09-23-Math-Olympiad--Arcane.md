Wifu: "聽說最近家長流行讓小朋友去學'奧數'，要不要讓小朋友去學學看?"

慶: "奧術?

妳是說施法念咒

發出火焰球那個!"

Wifu: "I heard that recently it is popular among parents to let their children learn the 'Math Olympiad.' Do you want your children to learn it?"

Qing: "Arcane?

Do you mean casting spells and chanting mantras?

The one that shoots out fireballs!"

NOTE: In Taiwanese, "Math Olympiad" and "Arcane" have the same pronunciation.
