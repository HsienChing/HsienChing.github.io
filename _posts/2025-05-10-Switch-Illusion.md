開關是一種二元選擇裝置，有開跟關兩個模式可以選擇。

對人而言，也會造成記憶上有開或關的暫存檔。

實際運作時，人類可能會根據記憶的暫存檔而行動，而非事實狀態而行動。

例如:

某天回家時，我看到媽媽有打開門鎖的動作，但當我要開門時，卻發現門是鎖住的狀態。

這表示我們都覺得門是鎖住的，而她做了操作，而我們都認為已經解鎖。

事實上卻是門根本沒鎖，而媽媽只是依照她的記憶點，門有鎖住，去做操作。

這時反而將門鎖起來了。

想要開門反而變成了鎖門!

The switch is a binary selection device, with two modes: on and off.

For humans, it will also cause a temporary file of on or off state in the memory.

In practice, humans may act based on temporary memory rather than factual states.

For example:

One day when I came home, I saw my mother unlocking the door, but when I tried to open the door, I found that the door was locked.

This means that we both thought the door was locked, she did the operation, and we both thought it was unlocked.

In fact, the door was not locked at all, and my mother just acted according to her memory that the door was locked.

At this time, the door was locked instead.

Trying to open the door turns into locking the door!
