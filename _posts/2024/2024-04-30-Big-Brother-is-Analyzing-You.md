現今的  
影像辨識  
與  
AI技術，

已經讓  
監控技術，  
大大超越  
小說1984中  
的  
老大哥系統了。

"老大哥正在看著你!"

早已經  
是"過去式"!

"老大哥正在分析你!"

是  
"現在進行式"!

也許  
人類  
未來  
會因為  
過度監控，  
而喪失  
行為彈性，  
失去創造力!

Today's  
image recognition  
and  
AI technology 

have made  
surveillance technology  
far beyond  
the Big Brother system  
in the novel  
1984.

"Big Brother is Watching You!"

It is already  
"past tense"!

"Big Brother is Analyzing You!"

It's  
"present continuous tense"!

Perhaps  
humans will  
lose behavioral flexibility  
and  
creativity  
in the future  
due to  
excessive monitoring!
