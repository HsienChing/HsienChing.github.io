下午，帶小朋友去游泳池游泳。

看天氣陰陰的，想說會下雨，所以帶了支雨傘過去。

剛接近游泳池會場時，開始下雨，看來這支雨傘帶得好。

到游泳池場館後，把雨傘放在場館外的傘桶裡面。

剛把小朋友送進去上課，一走出來，準備拿傘...

消失了!

看來是有人需要了!

看著傘桶中的其他雨傘，這時心中出現了善惡選擇題。

要不要拿一隻來用?!

想太多了，不用糾結啦! 雨中漫步，比較有趣!

那是支有福氣的雨傘!

祝福拿到的人，可以把福氣傳遞出去!

祝福!

In the afternoon, I took my child to the swimming pool.

The weather was overcast, so I thought it would rain and took an umbrella.

As we approached the swimming pool venue, it started to rain. It seemed that this umbrella was a good choice.

After arriving at the swimming pool, place the umbrella in the bucket outside the venue.

I just sent the children to class, and as soon as I came out, I was ready to grab an umbrella...

Gone!

Looks like someone needs it!

Looking at the other umbrellas in the bucket, a multiple-choice question of good and evil appeared in my mind.

Do you want to get one to use?!

Don't worry about thinking too much! Walking in the rain is more fun!

That is a blessed umbrella!

Those who receive blessings can pass on the blessings!

bless!
