老同學在美國為生活打拼中。

來到陌生的環境，特別是離開原生國家。瞬間就會少了很多支持。

能在外地獲得支持，並順利發展，這不容易。

祝福他在自己的努力還有身邊人的幫忙下，順利前行! ^_^

祝福他!

An old classmate is struggling in life in the United States.

Coming to a strange environment, especially leaving your country. A lot of support will be lost in an instant.

It is not easy to get support and develop smoothly in other places.

I wish him success with his own efforts and the help of those around him!

Bless him!
