人的記憶與認知很多時候會飄掉，而且仍會持續堅持自己是對的。

不知道什麼時候，我突然認為航海王的作者尾田榮一郎是一個共同名，由兩個人共同使用。這件事持續了幾年。

後來，去網路查一下資料，才發現是自己搞錯了!

不過也因為去查證資料，而對尾田榮一郎多了一些認識。

這可真有趣!

錯誤的記憶與認知，儘管會干擾對事情的判斷，但經過合適的處理，也有可能建立新的認知，發現新事物!

祝福我們可以突破錯誤的記憶與認知，發現新的可能性!

祝福我們!

Humans' memories and perceptions often drift away, and they will continue to insist that they are right.

I don't know when, I suddenly thought that the author of One Piece, Oda Eiichiro, is a common name, shared by two people. This went on for several years.

Later, I checked the information on the Internet and found out that I had made a mistake!

However, I also got to know more about Oda Eiichiro because I went to verify the information.

This is really interesting!

Although incorrect memories and perceptions will interfere with our judgment of things, with appropriate treatment, it is possible to establish new perceptions and discover new things!

Bless us to break through erroneous memories and perceptions, and then discover new possibilities!

Bless us!
