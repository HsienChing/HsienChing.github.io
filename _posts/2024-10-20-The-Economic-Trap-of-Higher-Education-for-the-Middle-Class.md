高等教育其實很貴，特別是去已開發國家留學。

獻慶的一位長輩，為了供應他的兒子去美國留學，讀博士。燒掉1000多萬，後來是賣掉一棟房子才湊足這些錢。

這位長輩的家庭環境，其實也不容易，他年輕時，從工人拚到經理，拚搏一輩子，總共也才累積兩棟房子。

而且當兒子從美國博士畢業後，有段時間找不到相對應的工作，失業了一陣子，這段時間也是長輩在支出兒子全家的開支。

後來終於兒子終於在台灣找到助理教授的工作。

但衝擊的事情在後面，這位長輩發現兒子在台灣的薪水，少得可憐，每個月的基本開銷結算後，能存下來的錢也不多了。那個已經燒掉的1000多萬，基本上看不到回本的機會。

在台灣的國立大學教授薪水可以用10萬來估計，私立可能就要打對折。

助理教授，薪水就更低，公立大學可能是5~7萬元，私立大學就要再打折。

如果以每個月存5萬元好了，那1000萬可能需要16年才存得到。

但實際狀況可能更糟，於是乎這位長輩才有一種"破滅感"。

不是說"書中自有黃金屋"嗎?

為什麼，送兒子出國留學，得燒掉一棟房子，而且他這輩子可能也賺不回來。

也許當年，送兒子出國留學，是很神氣的事情，可以跟身邊的人宣傳: "我的小孩出國念博士，我很驕傲!"

但很多事情，時間久了，會回到經濟的基本面。

這個出國留學，反而造成這個家庭的長期負債，而且是難以償還。

真的是很衝擊的案例，特別是發生自己身邊的人身上。

---

其實這也是一個家庭的資產配置問題。

對於中產階級來說，這樣難以回本的高等教育，可能就是一個經濟陷阱。

造成家庭整體資產縮水，也對家庭的未來發展，可能有不利的影響。

---

如果以一種迷思的角度來看。

"博士的兒子也要讀博士，不然沒面子!"

那這個家庭的兒子再讀一次博士的話，家庭資產應該就歸零，破產了。

畢竟
1. 爺爺努力工作，賺兩棟房。
2. 兒子努力出國留學，燒掉一棟，無法回本。剩一棟房。
3. 孫子再努力出國留學，再燒掉一棟，無法回本。歸零。

這樣算不算是"富不過三代"。

想起來有點恐怖，他們都很努力自己的人生! 也沒去吃喝嫖賭! 但家庭資產，就是歸零了。

獻慶的選擇:

當年幾個指導教授都很實在地提醒過我這個問題。

教授: "家裡錢不多的話，就不要出國留學，否則會拖垮整個家庭。

你也不要看我們這些教授是在外國讀博士就想出國，我們當年有政府想發展台灣的高等教育，於是提供獎學金，回國後，還提供教職的工作機會。後來獎學金慢慢變少，到沒有，教職的機會也趨向飽和，許多學校都是遇缺不補。"

經過考量，由於家裡確實資源不多，於是獻慶就決定在台灣念博士。

還好老師有支援經費，有些教授還提供打工機會，基本上博士班期間的收入可以持平，還有剩一點來存點小錢，沒有過度消耗家中資產。

---

祝福我們可以好好衡量自己家庭的經濟狀況，選擇合適的教育方案。

也許家庭在發展到某個世代時，經濟狀況足夠穩健了，再來考慮高等教育也是好事!

祝福我們!

Higher education is actually costly, especially studying in developed countries.

One of my elders wanted to provide for his son to study in the United States and get a Ph.D. To raise the money, more than 300,000 USD was burned, and a house was sold.

This elder's family environment is not easy. When he was young, he worked hard all his life from worker to manager, and only accumulated two houses in total.

Moreover, after his son graduated with a Ph.D. in the United States, he couldn't find a corresponding job for a while. During this time, the elder was also paying for his son's family's expenses.

Later, his son finally found a job as an assistant professor in Taiwan.

But the shock came later. The elder discovered that his son's salary in Taiwan was pitiful. After settling the monthly basic expenses, there was not much money left to save. The money of more than 300,000 USD that has been burned in higher education has basically no chance of getting back.

The salary of professors at public universities in Taiwan can be estimated at 3,000 USD, while private universities may pay half the price.

For assistant professors, the salary is even lower. It may be 2,000 to 2,500 yuan in public universities, and there will be further discounts in private universities.

If he saves 1,500 USD per month, it may take about 16 years to save 300,000 USD.

But the real situation may be worse, so this elder has a sense of "disillusionment."

Isn't the idiom said that "the book has its own golden house?"

Why sending his son to study abroad would cost him a house, and his son might not be able to earn it back in his lifetime.

Maybe in those days, sending his son to study abroad was a very prestigious thing, and he could publicize it to people around him: "My child is studying abroad for a Ph.D., I am very proud!"

But many things, over time, will return to economic fundamentals.

Studying abroad has caused long-term debt for the family, which is difficult to repay.

It's a really shocking case, especially if it happens to someone close to me.

---

In fact, this is also a family asset allocation issue.

For the middle class, higher education that is difficult to repay may be an economic trap.

This causes the overall assets of the family to shrink, which may also have a negative impact on the future development of the family.

---

If you look at it from a mythic perspective.

"The son of a doctor must also study for a doctorate, otherwise he will feel shameful!"

If the son of this family studies for a Ph.D. again, the family assets will return to zero and become bankrupt.

After all
1. Grandpa works hard to earn two houses.
2. His son works hard to study abroad, but burned down a house and was unable to get his money back. There is only one house left.
3. His grandson works hard again to study abroad, he will burn down another house, and he will never be able to get his money back. Return to zero.

Does this count as "The father buys, the son builds, the grandchild sells, and his son begs."

It's a bit scary to think about it. They all worked hard in their lives! They didn't go out to eat, drink or gamble! However, the family assets were reduced to zero.

---

My decision:

Several supervisors at that time reminded me of this issue very seriously.

Professor: "If your family doesn't have much money, don't go to higher education abroad. Otherwise, it will bring down the whole family."

Don't think about repeating our experience of going to higher education abroad. Back then, our government wanted to develop higher education in Taiwan, so it provided full scholarships and offered professors job opportunities after returning to Taiwan. Later, the scholarships gradually became less and less, and the professor opportunities became saturated, and many universities failed to fill the gaps."

After careful consideration, since my family did not have many resources, I decided to study for a doctorate in Taiwan.

Fortunately, my supervisor supported me with funds, and some professors also provided part-time job opportunities to me. Basically, the income during the doctoral program can be the same, and there is still a little left to save a little money, without excessive consumption of family assets.

---

I wish that we could carefully evaluate our family's financial situation and choose an appropriate higher education plan.

Maybe when the family reaches a certain generation and the financial situation is stable enough, it would be a good thing to consider higher education!

Bless us!

目前 OECD（經濟合作暨發展組織）對中產階級定義，是家庭或個人所得，介於全體所得，中位數 75 % 至 200 % 的人，若以台灣家庭平均所得 94 萬換算來看，年收入要在 70.5 萬至 188 萬的區間，才能被稱為中產階級。
94 *  75% =  70.5
94 * 200% = 188
