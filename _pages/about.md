> I'm an ordinary person with some strange dreams. I'll achieve my dreams step by step.

> Some life events that are strange to me, and I will write them down. I hope these stories might encourage others. In the strange world. You are not alone! I will be with you.

# Dreams might be achieved through this blog

1. A poetry collection, containing 100 poems. (來出個詩集，蒐集100首)
2. Some life stories that might encourage others. (In the strange world. You are not alone! I will be with you.)




# Dreams that have been achieved through this blog

On going.

# About Our recent projects and servies on high mountains

Building and maintaining the off-grid solar energy storage systems on high mountains, such as Paiyun Lodge (the highest lodge in Taiwan), Tianchi Lodge (a famous "five star" lodge in Taiwan), and Jiujiu Lodge.

> It is our responsibility to maintain the power system of the lodge well so that our mountain friends can have good service!

## Current Projects
### Development of Cloud-native Energy Management Systems for Medium-scale Energy Storage Systems

This project aims to develop cloud-native energy management systems for monitoring, controlling, and optimizing medium-scale energy storage systems. The on-site hardware will cooperate with cloud-native energy management software to ensure system functionality, stability, and safety. The cloud-native time-series database and cross-platform monitoring interface can provide high-speed data input/output for statistic analysis, e.g., trend analysis, energy consumption tracking, cost-saving opportunity identification, as well as energy cost and consumption reductions. Moreover, the project can promote the development of the domestic energy storage industry.
